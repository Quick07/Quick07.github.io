        <title>This is a Book Club Website for College Students</title>

            <h1>This is the website heading!</h1>
            <p>This website will be used as a way for me and my friends to build and practice our coding skills as we learn to develop websites with backend and frontend.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Furhter, we hope to create multiple websites that can be used by students around campus daily (and potentially) turn a profit. Our ideas at the moment include a book club website and a outfit selector website.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Hopefully, we can turn these into apps that can be used on both iOS and android in the future (if they gain some traction)</p>
